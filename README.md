# citibikes-tableau-challenge
For this challenge I used Citi Bike Data. As all the data sets were seperated by months, each month different csv file. I've used data for two months March 2017 and january 2017. I've decided to use Python to combine all the files to one csv file for future use in Tableau dashboard creation.
